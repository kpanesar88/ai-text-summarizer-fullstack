# Quick Extract - Text Summarizer

Quick Extract is a web application designed to help users quickly summarize large blocks of text using AI-powered technology. This tool uses the Xenova Transformers library to provide concise and coherent summaries, saving time and improving efficiency.

## Features

- **Text Summarization:** Quickly summarize large blocks of text.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple interface to input text and get summaries.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the summarization process might take some time to complete. Due to the limitations of the current model, the application may become temporarily unresponsive while generating summaries. This is a known issue, and we appreciate your patience. The application will resume normal functionality once the summarization is complete.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Text:** Type or paste your text into the input area.
2. **Summarize:** Click the "Summarize" button to generate a concise summary.
3. **Review and Save:** View the summary and copy or save it as needed.

## Performance and Improvement

### Timing and Performance Metrics

For performance analysis, the application includes built-in timers that measure the time taken for each major task. These timings are logged in the console, providing insights into the processing duration. This feature helps in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing the summarization process.

### Improving Model Performance

If you find that the summarization process is too slow or if you want to explore more advanced options, consider the following recommendations:

- **Replace the Model:** Currently, the application uses a model from the Xenova Transformers library. For potentially better performance, you might consider using ChatGPT-4 or another more advanced model. ChatGPT-4 can provide improved summarization quality and faster processing times.
- **Optimize Your Setup:** Review the performance logs and consider optimizing the pipeline or switching to a more efficient model if necessary.
